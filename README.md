A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The Android app uses the backend URL configured by `API_BASE_URL`.

Run on a physical device connected to the same network as the backend:

```powershell
flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.11:8080/api
```

Run on the standard Android Emulator:

```powershell
flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8080/api
```

The default URL is `http://192.168.1.11:8080/api`. If the computer's LAN IP
changes, pass the current IP using `--dart-define`.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
